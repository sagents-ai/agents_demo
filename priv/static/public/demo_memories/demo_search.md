# Project Demo Document

This is a demonstration file for testing the search_text functionality.

## Introduction

Welcome to this demo file! This document contains various sections with different types of content that we can search through.

TODO: Add more detailed introduction with project background

## Features

### Feature 1: Text Search
The search_text tool allows you to find patterns across files. It supports:
- Case-sensitive and case-insensitive searches
- Regular expressions
- Context lines around matches
- Searching specific files or all files

### Feature 2: File Management
TODO: Document the file management capabilities

You can organize files in a hierarchical structure using directories and subdirectories.

## Tasks and Planning

Here are some items that need attention:

1. Review the documentation
2. TODO: Test edge cases with special characters
3. Update examples
4. TODO: Add performance benchmarks

## Code Examples

```python
def search_example():
    # TODO: Implement error handling
    result = perform_search("pattern")
    return result
```

## Notes

- Remember to test with various file types
- Consider internationalization
- TODO: Check compatibility with older versions

## Conclusion

This demo file should provide plenty of material for testing search functionality. The TODO items are scattered throughout different sections to demonstrate context-based searching.

TODO: Add appendix with additional resources
