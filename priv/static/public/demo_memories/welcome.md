# Welcome to the Agent Demo

This is a sample memory file that demonstrates the FileSystem capabilities.

## Features

- **Virtual Filesystem**: Files are stored in a virtual filesystem that can be accessed by the agent
- **Persistent Storage**: Files are persisted to disk using the Persistence.Disk backend
- **Agent Access**: The agent can read, write, and manipulate these files

## Getting Started

Try asking the agent to:
- Read this file
- Create a new file
- List all files in the Memories directory
- Update existing files

The agent has full access to these files and can help you manage them!
